        "paragraph": "The Instructional Equity Observing Tool is an online video/audio analysis tool that is geared towards assisting the teachers and faculty of educational institutions in analyzing and understanding how their interaction with students translates into real learning. Our platform is meant to replace the current, manual method of analysis that many teachers/instructors perform to try and quantify different metrics about their teacher-student interaction. Instructors have expressed desire to view metrics such as the time the teacher talks during a lesson, what is the response time of students to those questions, and other data points such as the types of questions being asked (as categorized by Bloom’s Taxonomy). Quantifying these instructional variables helps these instructors more accurately understand the areas that they are strong in, and more importantly, the areas in which they can be more interactive with the students as to allow them to better absorb the lessons being taught. With the help of our tool (hosted at https://ai4c.eurekalabs.net), we can allow teachers to quickly and efficiently gather this data about each of their lessons so that data driven changes in teaching techniques is possible, and moreover, so that teachers can identify potential vectors of ineffective instruction.",

In late 2015, it defeated a human professional player at the board game Go for the first time in history; this was a signal achievement in computer science in general, and a breakthrough in the field of AI in particular. Since then, successors of AlphaGo have reached even greater playing strength. The incorporation of artificial neural network was a critical feature in the design of those algorithms. The superhuman playing strength of the AI agents raises many interesting questions and challenges, among them the quantitative assessment of their strength, the probe, identification, and demonstration of deficiencies in the algorithms, and the possibility of their improvement with human aid. We are currently focusing on the study of such questions on a Go board of reduced size. We have already obtained certain definitive results, and have gained insights along the way. Our work has also spawned further, more foundational questions concerning AI design, especially artificial neural network. We look forward to doing further research on those questions as well—we have a long way “2 Go”!",
